PGM Spring 2018 | Final Project
Pseudocode README | Last Updated 04/03/18


To run this code, you will need...

Python (I wrote in 2.7...higher version may be compatible, lower versions may not)
Python libraries: numpy, scipy, matplotlib, pandas, sklearn (Most downloads for scientific "packagings" of Python will contain these modules.  My personal favorite is Anaconda, which includes the Spyder IDE.)


To set up file paths...

You must keep the directory structure that this comes zipped in (i.e. PGM_Spr2018\Project_python holds all scripts, PGM_Spr2018\Project_python\data holds all csv's, named as they are in the original zip).  You may have to modify the usbDriveLetter field in props.py - this will be the prefix directory to wherever you have unzipped the top level "PGM_Spr2018" folder.  Thefile props.py should be the only location where you must make this modification - all other files take direction from props.


Please let me know if you have any significant issues with the code.
